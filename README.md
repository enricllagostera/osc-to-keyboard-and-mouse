# OSC to keyboard / mouse

A few Python scripts for converting between [OSC messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control), mouse and keyboard events. The intent of these are for playing already existing games using sensors from a mobile phone (using something like [Sensors2OSC](https://sensors2.org/)) or some other application that can send OSC messages. This is not really a r-usable library or tool, just an example of how to go about making this functionality happen.

**Dependencies:** [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard), [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) and [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc) libraries.
